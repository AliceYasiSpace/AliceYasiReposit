                <br>
              <p>Tai Wah Co., located at 303 S. Clark St in 1906, was one of the largest stores, or companies, or enterprises in the Chinese community and neighborhood in Chicago. 
                Inspector L. J. Plummer once testified that the company was “one of the largest Chinese establishments in Chicago.” 
                Indeed, the incredible number of appearances of the name “Tai Wah Co.” in the Return Application Files collected at the National Archives in Chicago evidence the enterprise’s operation scale. 
                Its business model, starting from a grocery and Chinese and Japanese goods store and expanding to profitable Chinese restaurants, 
                was incredibly successful in its period and provided jobs and temporary homes for a lot of immigrants, mostly from the family clan of Moy (梅), 
                who worked there and did business with the company. It further served as a community center, not only as a store connecting and supporting 
                the lives and economies of Chinese immigrants across the Midwest and the Great Lake area; it also represented the immigrants and took care 
                of their affairs during the Return Certificate Application process. The manager of the Co., Moy Sam/Moy You Foo 梅耀福, always showed up to 
                testify for his staff. Meanwhile, many immigrants who lived outside of the Loop or Chicago or without a fixed or renowned working address, 
                to fulfill the long communication process of certificate application, would put the address of 303 S. Clark St or Tai Wah Co. on their applications 
                (same applied to other large firms at the Clark St). The storefront was a popular social venue for close friends and family hanging out with 
                one another while the three floors above the store were often rented out as residences to host the immigrants.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The store was established as early as in or before the year 1888 under the name “Quong Wah Chong Co.” The earliest member who joined the Co. 
                and applied for the return certificate was Moy Jung/Moy Ching (File 571) who joined the Co. in 1888. The Co. was initially located at 315 S. Clark St.. 
                It was succeeded by Tai Wah Co. about 1895 when Moy Sam/Moy You Foo became the manager of the company. Around the year 1907, the value of the goods 
                in the store was between $18,000 and $29,000 while holding probably more than $30,000 capital as stocks invested by the immigrants who would take their 
                savings and borrow money to put into the Co. to receive a stable dividend return and credibility for their certificate application. Nonetheless, 
                though the job at Tai Wah Co., with the title of a merchant, guarantees a smooth application process, the salary here could be comparatively low in comparison 
                to other firms or self-operated businesses. A normal shop member, Moy Dock/Moy Seow Nie (File 646), got paid $35 a month without dividend in 1908, 
                of which the amount is quite low even in the year 1904-06, while the manager gets multiple salaries from each business for $40-50 a month (File 666). 
                In the restaurants operated under Tai Wah that will be mentioned in the upcoming paragraph, a cook like Ah Song/Law Gwone 亞生 would be paid $55-60 
                a month in 1906 (File 405) or Moy Kee Doy for $12 a week in 1905 (File 365). Staff List of Tai Wah Co. in one interview of 1908 (File 646) is given below: 
                Moy Lung You/Moy Sick 梅锡(bookkeeper) (File 365, 609, 666, 687), Lee Park, Moy Mun, Moy Toy, Moy Hor, Moy Tom (File 687), Moy Wing, Moy Sue Hing, Moy Yoke 
                (File 153, 454), Moy Dock, and Moy Sam/Moy You Foo/Moy You Sam (owner). Staff residing in China at that moment would not be counted. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The business development of Tai Wah Co. into the restaurant business was the successful establishment of two large and popular Chinese restaurants, 
                Wee Ying Lo at 174 S. Clark St, which opened on February 5th, 1904 (or December 1903), and Song Ying Lo at 119 S. Clark St, which opened around the same time as the former. 
                In 1906, the capital of the two restaurants was $40000 in Song Ying Lo and $30000 in Wee Ying Lo and soon reached an incredible $80000 in total with great profits, 
                shocking the inspector L. J. Plummer even stated that such a number is a conservative one (File 634). L. J. Plummer saw these two restaurants growing under 
                the wing and from the capital of Tai Wah Co. and thus made a $30000 to $80000 growth in the business. The dividend at the restaurant is 7% annually (File 365 & 506). 
                The two restaurants had roughly 25 partners who might have invested between $500-2500 into the business thus making up the capital (File 405). 
                As the owner of the three businesses, Moy Sam’s personal investment in the Co. ($1800) and the restaurants ($2600) would be around and more than $4400 (File 666).</p>
