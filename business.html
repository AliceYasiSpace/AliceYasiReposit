                <br>
              <p>Tai Wah Co., located at 303 S. Clark St in 1906, was one of the largest stores, or companies, or enterprises in the Chinese community and neighborhood in Chicago. 
                Inspector L. J. Plummer once testified that the company was “one of the largest Chinese establishments in Chicago.” 
                Indeed, the incredible number of appearances of the name “Tai Wah Co.” in the Return Application Files collected at the National Archives in Chicago evidence the enterprise’s operation scale. 
                Its business model, starting from a grocery and Chinese and Japanese goods store and expanding to profitable Chinese restaurants, 
                was incredibly successful in its period and provided jobs and temporary homes for a lot of immigrants, mostly from the family clan of Moy (梅), 
                who worked there and did business with the company. It further served as a community center, not only as a store connecting and supporting 
                the lives and economies of Chinese immigrants across the Midwest and the Great Lake area; it also represented the immigrants and took care 
                of their affairs during the Return Certificate Application process. The manager of the Co., Moy Sam/Moy You Foo 梅耀福, always showed up to 
                testify for his staff. Meanwhile, many immigrants who lived outside of the Loop or Chicago or without a fixed or renowned working address, 
                to fulfill the long communication process of certificate application, would put the address of 303 S. Clark St or Tai Wah Co. on their applications 
                (same applied to other large firms at the Clark St). The storefront was a popular social venue for close friends and family hanging out with 
                one another while the three floors above the store were often rented out as residences to host the immigrants.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The store was established as early as in or before the year 1888 under the name “Quong Wah Chong Co.” The earliest member who joined the Co. 
                and applied for the return certificate was Moy Jung/Moy Ching (File 571) who joined the Co. in 1888. The Co. was initially located at 315 S. Clark St.. 
                It was succeeded by Tai Wah Co. about 1895 when Moy Sam/Moy You Foo became the manager of the company. Around the year 1907, the value of the goods 
                in the store was between $18,000 and $29,000 while holding probably more than $30,000 capital as stocks invested by the immigrants who would take their 
                savings and borrow money to put into the Co. to receive a stable dividend return and credibility for their certificate application. Nonetheless, 
                though the job at Tai Wah Co., with the title of a merchant, guarantees a smooth application process, the salary here could be comparatively low in comparison 
                to other firms or self-operated businesses. A normal shop member, Moy Dock/Moy Seow Nie (File 646), got paid $35 a month without dividend in 1908, 
                of which the amount is quite low even in the year 1904-06, while the manager gets multiple salaries from each business for $40-50 a month (File 666). 
                In the restaurants operated under Tai Wah that will be mentioned in the upcoming paragraph, a cook like Ah Song/Law Gwone 亞生 would be paid $55-60 
                a month in 1906 (File 405) or Moy Kee Doy for $12 a week in 1905 (File 365). Staff List of Tai Wah Co. in one interview of 1908 (File 646) is given below: 
                Moy Lung You/Moy Sick 梅锡(bookkeeper) (File 365, 609, 666, 687), Lee Park, Moy Mun, Moy Toy, Moy Hor, Moy Tom (File 687), Moy Wing, Moy Sue Hing, Moy Yoke 
                (File 153, 454), Moy Dock, and Moy Sam/Moy You Foo/Moy You Sam (owner). Staff residing in China at that moment would not be counted. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The business development of Tai Wah Co. into the restaurant business was the successful establishment of two large and popular Chinese restaurants, 
                Wee Ying Lo at 174 S. Clark St, which opened on February 5th, 1904 (or December 1903), and Song Ying Lo at 119 S. Clark St, which opened around the same time as the former. 
                In 1906, the capital of the two restaurants was $40000 in Song Ying Lo and $30000 in Wee Ying Lo and soon reached an incredible $80000 in total with great profits, 
                shocking the inspector L. J. Plummer even stated that such a number is a conservative one (File 634). L. J. Plummer saw these two restaurants growing under 
                the wing and from the capital of Tai Wah Co. and thus made a $30000 to $80000 growth in the business. The dividend at the restaurant is 7% annually (File 365 & 506). 
                The two restaurants had roughly 25 partners who might have invested between $500-2500 into the business thus making up the capital (File 405). 
                As the owner of the three businesses, Moy Sam’s personal investment in the Co. ($1800) and the restaurants ($2600) would be around and more than $4400 (File 666).</p>

                Hip Lung Co. (323 S. Clark St), Shanghai Restaurant (251/253 S. Clark St)

              <p>
                Hip Lung Co. or Hip Lung Ying(Yee) Kee, at 323 S. Clark St, according to Huping Ling’s research, was bought by Moy Dung Chow or Moy Tung Jew/Moy Tong Chane/Moy Tung Joe in the late 1870s. Then it was operated under the Moy (Dung) brothers of Moy Tung Jew at the beginning and Moy Dung Hoy 梅宗海 from 1882 (File 459). This franchise was once older and bigger than the Tai Wah Co.. The company sold groceries, tea, silk, fancy goods, and Chinese and Japanese merchandise. The staff here received $35 a month for their salary while the bookkeeper had $40, at the same level as Tai Wah Co..
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                In 1905, the business had $40000 and more capital investments among 34-35 partners (File 414). It continued to grow in the year 1906 when it made $10000 more in sales than last year with average annual sales of around $60000 (File 441, 510). The manager Moy Dung Hoy in his testimony on July 18th, 1906 stated that the business of the Co. had been better than ever because there were a lot of new Chinese restaurants demanding groceries and wares from the Co. to embellish the dazzling decorated restaurant; and just in last week, the company had received 600 cases of goods from China (File 464). The Chinese companies largely relied on importing goods from China and supplied them to surrounding restaurants and immigrants in the city or outside the city. Thus, they interacted with import officers like Henry C. Dana or custom house clerk Charles B. Wright on a daily basis while the latter normally served as one of the white witnesses to counterbalance or testify the integrity of the business or individuals. Most of the time, their testimonies were not included in the files and appeared as signatures. Besides Dana didn’t testify for Hip Lung Co., salesmen like Leo Stein from 1440 Masonic Temple and Willard J. Henry, from 1605 Fisher Building, Wheeler, Fisher & Co., a paper bag manufacturer, would have supplied paper bags for the grocery.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Even in a business as prominent as Hip Lung Co., problems around stable operation and staff’s re-entry/return application (to the States) still occurred as a staff, Moy Gow, was bitterly denied for his entry in 1904 that Moy King 梅乾 bought out the former’s share eventually (File 521). Such a scenario occurred normally when the firm had unstable business so that the returning immigrant lost his investment, property, or debts in the States. Unfortunately, we don’t have more details regarding Moy Gow’s case. Another example would come from the interview Moy Dung Hoy 梅宗海 had in September 1908. Business competitions and buying-out were very common among the Chinese immigrant community. Hip Lung Co. was bought out and re-incorporated in late November 1907. Only 13 out of 34 previous partners continued in the new corporation without selling their shares while the 34 original partners were only returned with their pro-rata proportion out of $5000 or $7000 of the declining business of Hip Lung Co.. It was reduced to ⅛ or ⅙ of its original size. Thus, the Co. in 1908 interview only had $17000 capital among 13 partners, which was a huge impact on the business, or a huge blow to the investors of the company especially to those who still resided in China and intended to come back to the States at that time. It also proved that business changes so much in the Chinese community, sometimes with great profits and sometimes with great losses in a very short period of time; the prominent firm could not even guarantee permanent stability. Nonetheless, such a change is relevant to the business model each large family firm undertook. The upcoming case of Chin F. Foin evidences this phenomenon as well.

              <br>
              <p>
                The list of active full-time staff in the store given in June 1906 (File 484) would be: Moy Tong Joe, the former manager (File 353; 441; 459; 609); Moy Dung Hoy 梅宗海 the manager himself (File 353; 393; 414; 418; 428; 431; 441; 455; 459; 463; 464; 473; 484; 510; 521; 556; 609; 678; 688; 701); Moy Choon; Moy Ham (bookkeeper/treasurer) (File 428, 556); Moy Han; Moy Lee; Moy Cong; Moy Toy (File 428); and applicant Moy Shuck (File 155, 484) who would not be getting salary since the first of the months since he would be departing for China. Such a list fluctuates with minor changes in each interview due to individual merchant’s activity of collecting money out of town or returning to China for business shopping or individual reasons like visiting families or getting married since women weren’t typically allowed to come to the States (another reason for causing prostitution). For example, long-time staff Moy Bing/Moy Ben (File 459, 428, 368, applied to return certificate in 431) did not appear in this list.

              <br>
              <p>
                Though the company was huge, they didn’t launch an investment as Tai Wah Co., only the Shanghai Restaurant at 251/253 S. Clark St was briefly mentioned and organized by the manager Moy Dung Hoy. It seems that most of the Co.’s members didn’t invest much in the restaurant. Nonetheless, the restaurant had accumulated a $40000 investment among 16 stockholders in 1906 (File 393).
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                The manager Moy Dung Hoy 梅宗海 was charismatic and caring for his staff as Moy Sam of Tai Wah Co., as he always testified for his merchants. One testimony from File 701 shows the responsibility of the manager or leader of the family. When Moy Ing/Moy Bow/Moy Tung Hong was trying to sell his laundry business at 1418 W. Madison St for $1120 but no one would purchase at the moment, Moy Dung Hoy took the debt and held the laundry for months until Moy Sam and Moy Gew bought them. It would not be a small cost for the manager himself who had a $6000 investment in Tai Wah Co. as the investment wasn’t fully cashed out.

                Wing Chong Hai Co. (281 S. Clark St), Joy Yet Lo (291 S. Clark St)
                <br>Chin F. Foin, Chin/Chen Family
            </button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Wing Chong Hai Co., located between 319 S. Clark St (early and later phase) and 281 S. Clark St (middle phase), was established around 1890 according to the manager Chin F. Foin/Chin Fung Foin/Chin Fahn Foon 陳宏勲 (File 427). In the year 1906 and most of the time covered by our collected immigrant file in this research (1898-1909), the Co. was operated under Chin F. Foin, Chin Yun Quai/Chin Yen Quai/Chin Lin Quai 陳賢逵, and Chin F. Toy/Chin Fung Toy, the three brothers. It was formerly founded by Chin Ming Chung, who was the active manager of the Co. from 1892 to 1897, with Chin Mow Hai, Chin Seek Mon, Chin Doon, and Chin Tuck, the official manager of business cards (File 427). According to Chin Ming Chung’s interview, the Co. began in 1892. After Chin Ming Chung’s departure, Chin Seek Mon and Chin Yu Soon (not on the previous founder list) became the managers of the company; and later, Chin F. Foin brothers took over the business when they bought out the Co. around the year 1901. Chin F. Foin, according to the inspector, spoke great English. In Dr. Huping Ling’s stories of Chin F. Foin, the business was as well talented in horse riding and speaking German. He was that young and promising businessman, only 29 years old in the year of 1906, and the representative of Chinese immigrants with great virtues and ability to assimilate as an American.</p>
              <br>
              <p>
                The Co. operated a large business with limited staff. In 1906, they made around $50000-60000 business a year but with 8 members, similar in size to the first two companies Tai Wah Co. and Hip Lung Co.. The member list in that year is Chin F. Foin (manager), Chin Yun Quay (manager/treasurer), Chin Wing Yin/Chin Hee, Ng Toy Kee, Ching Wing, Ching Fahn (Fung/Fong) Kee, Chin Ning, and Chin Der Bow. The salary in the Co. was comparatively higher than the previous Moy Family’s firm. A merchant in Wing Chong Hai Co. would be paid around $45-60 a month in the year 1907 while the manager Chin F. Foin had a fixed salary of $120 a month (File 440, 545, 577). While the capital remained at $25000 and the value of goods was about $14000-25000 in the Co., great size but smaller than Tai Wah Co., in 1907 and 1908, the company was under bad business and bought out in 1909 by Wing King Hong Co./Lun Chung Co. in 1909, when Chin F. Foin’s brother, Chin F. Toy, and staff returned to China so that no one was able to support the business (File 576, 650, 661). Meanwhile, the “factional war” between the Moy and Chin families, not only led to the death of a prominent Chin family member Chin Way, but also deeply damaged the business of the Chin Family considering the great share and force of the previous two Moy Family’s companies (File 650). Such an incident led to a debate on the eligibility of the bankrupted/bought-out merchants returning to the States from China, within the immigration inspector office. Kindly, L. T. Plummer, who was the head of the inspector office in Chicago, believed that it would only do justice to those merchants by admitting them back in.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Similar to other companies, Wing Chong Hai Co. also operated a business of Chinese restaurants, Joy Yet Lo at 291 S. Clark St. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                While the business case of Wing Chong Hai Co. was not complicated, the stories of individual staff of the Co. have demonstrated a spectrum of social phenomena that the Chicago Chinese community had encountered, through which we are able to gain insights into how the Chinese immigrants balanced their relationship with the Americans, adapted to the new society while preserved their culture, and maintained close connections to their families back in China.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                First, we have the application of the Chin F. Foin family in File 440 with his wife Yoklund Wong. Wong was the daughter of immigrant Wong Duck and Quak See (See, as 氏, meaning family name and thus denoting the character before See, such as “Quak” here is the family name of the wife), born in San Francisco and lived at 718 Commercial St before moving to Chicago. American-born Chinese were rarely seen in this early period under the sanctions imposed on the entry of Chinese females. Nonetheless, among those files, we often see young American-born Chinese females getting married to businessmen. Such a notion of getting married and the appropriate married age, which is way too young from a contemporary perspective, still followed those of the traditional values in China. When Chin F. Foin and Yoklund Wong returned to China, like the application case 440 of the newly wedded couple, it was to bring the bride to meet with the parents of the groom, or later, their children. On the other hand, many of the application cases were made for the bachelor immigrant workers to go back to China to reunite with their wives they hadn't seen for five years or to find a wife, get married, and hopefully have a child with the new wife then soon return to the States. Rarely, the well-established businessmen, who were mostly of a greater age like the Moy family, were able to bring their wives to the States, whose names remained in the more traditional format, only their fathers’ last names were kept and crowned with “See” in the end. In this case and the tiny details of the application, we can see how Chin F. Foin and his wife had differentiated themselves from those of the older generation.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                The second phenomenon is of the diaspora trajectory of Chinese immigrants. For the generation in the 1890s and early 1900s, though a lot of them would work in the States for tens or twenty years, mostly on distinct jobs such as railroad worker, laundryman, or even merchants, they nonetheless returned to China for retirement. It mirrors the traditional Chinese value of returning to your root when you fall like a leaf, 落叶归根. It answers the question of why Chinese railroad workers wanted to send their bodies or ashes to China if they died in the States and the whole Chinese association acting as an agency that supported this. Oftentimes, when they returned, they would either take their children born in the States with them to China or leave the children to their reliable family relatives to take care of. For example, Chin Yun Quai, a cousin of Chin Ning’s father, would testify for Chin Ning on his American-born identity, and visit Chin Ning when he was still a young adolescent in San Francisco while his father was already in China. The tight family connection, fraternity,  and trust, as great virtues respected in Chinese society, were seen in so many of these application files and in these cases of family-operated businesses. Though American media preferred to highlight the Clan or Tong wars between prominent families, the former and the immigration inspectors often ignored the key aspect and the importance of the emotional and cultural linkage of one immigrant seeing another with the same last name and their bonding within the large clan or family, on that harsh, challenging diaspora journey, under that constant inspection, distrust, and even antagonism projected by the Anglo-American communities. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                The inspectors often voiced their concern about the integrity of the Chinese immigrants in their frequent borrowing of money for business investment, to pass paperwork like return certificate applications, or to send home to China. Questions such as if the debtor would ever return the money were asked during the examination. Nonetheless, in file 522, ​​Ching Yee answered that "All Chinamen start from China without any money and while we are in this country we ought to help each other what we can. If I am good enough to lend money to them they ought to pay me back, but if they don't I will call it lost." The supportive community of compatriots and good faith in each other is often seen among the Chinese immigrants in the United States. They would lend money out to their friends and relatives who had needs because they understood them in that diasporic cultural context, the need to take care of distant parents, the pride they undertook as they departed far, the resolution to find themselves a business and place to survive in a foreign country. It was also a relationship based on trust and hope to be helped in the future if needed. Those notions were not that different from a lot of immigrants in the States. Though some debts and money were not paid or returned due to different reasons, it was not an excuse or base for the inspectors to conclude a certain pattern or quality of those immigrants as they did in the interview with Ching Yee and many others.

                Wah Kee Co. was a unique business on South Clark St. It was first organized by Sam Moy, credited as the Mayor of Chinatown in the American press. The shop was initially located at 319 S. Clark St tobacco business. Besides a storefront that sells cigars, opium, and tobacco in general, the company also owns a cigar factory that manufactures the goods. After the death of Sam Moy in May 1902, the shop owner, the partner Moy Doon Yuen, and possibly Moy Wah Foon as well, bought out Sam Moy’s share, and later moved to 333 S. Clark St around the second half of 1905.

He started with business in interpretation, with his fluent English, and laundry shops. In 1889, Moy decided to start a cigar factory, employing 12 Chinese cigar makers. The shop which would become the Wah Kee Co. was begun in 1892. Later, seizing the potential economic opportunity of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, established the Chinese Theatre and coordinated the troupe of hundreds of theatrical actors from China to perform. and eventually died in bankruptcy, with only his cigar business Wah Kee Co. left.(see <a href="https://ccamuseum.org/rival-chinese-exposition-plans/">“Rival Chinese Exposition Plans”</a> on the Chinese American Museum of Chicago website)

                The other Moy family members in the Co. Moy Wah Foon and Moy Doon Yuen together purchased the $2000 share of Sam Moy in the Co. and co-operated with Moy Toy and Lam Moy whose share, which totaled $2000, were later purchased by the former in 1908.

                The importance of Wah Kee Co. in this study not only lies in its unique presence as the only Cigar shop and factory established in the Clark neighborhood, the photos of Sam Moy’s funeral ceremony, which was centered at the Co. at 319 S. Clark St in 1902 and spread across the block, enabled us to see and essentially understand what the neighborhood, or the so-called and forgotten “Chinatown,” was like a hundred years ago. The architecture and shops along South Clark Street, from roughly number 310 to 320 were clearly visible. Thousands of immigrants gathered in the area, mostly in suits and fedora hats, joined by Anglo-American police, journalists, and probably the cigar dealer Charles Hoffman and those who were in business with Wah Kee Co.. It was an urban festival where people were paying tribute to Sam Moy, an established and leading businessman in the town. Continuing their cultural practice remote from their hometowns, the family and friends of Moy set up a little tent area, to host the altar table that serves the plaque, incense, and food (delicious roasted duck and baby pig) honoring the deceased. These photos interrogate the notion of the orientalist assumption imposed on the Chinese immigrants, and challenge, and reject the framed view of Chinatown as an enclosed and secluded ethnic enclave. Meanwhile, along with the interview of the immigrants’ returning application, the photos provide us with more insights into the community living on South Clark Street.

                The buildings on two sides of South Clark Street were decorated with signs of ticket booths for trains operating through LaSalle Stations, residential hotels, bars, and restaurants, with bodies of people stretching out of the windows or balconies. The image somehow resembles that painting of Childe Hassam The Fourth of July, 1916. The sidewalks were crowded with immigrants in ironed, clean, full sets of black suits. They waited in order and left space for the cable cars, carriages, or chariots. They looked over one another to anticipate the ceremony that will pay tribute to the deceased Sam Moy, looked up at the memorial banners/couplets the company and widow had put out for Moy as well as the presence of the widow of Moy, possibly the lady in white on the second-floor balcony, who might be hosting the event. The people on the left side of the street, in front of the Co., were walking in procession but most of the people across the street stood straight, facing the building of 319 S. Clark St, evidenced by the unified long rims of fedora hats. It was their moment of mourning, bonding with the community and families, and finding comfort and pride in their compatriots’ presence. All of them were immersed in this moment, preserving their cultural values and connection in the urban space of Chicago.

                When the immigrant community anticipated the ceremony and looked toward Wah Kee Co., in the photographs, the focus was between the police and ceremonial food, making the immigrants part of the background. One Anglo-American police officer was staring through the lens and another one was turning toward the lens in another photograph. The officer sent out a mixed signal on his watch. Unlike the immigrants, absorbed in the ceremony, walking away or either looking at the building, the police felt detached and alerted, putting his hand between the buttons of his uniform coat and seemingly stroking his stomach. He looked at the roasted pig and through, but would not fix his eyes on the ceremony. His gaze traveled with people, following any uncommon noise or things that called to his attention. He felt strange but performed his surveying, authoritative role of controlling and inspecting the immigrants and their movement, like that of the inspectors in the immigration bureau. If the protrusion of the police’s gaze subtly reveals the tension between the Chinese and Anglo-American community in Chicago, then the focus of photographs implicates the authority of the narrative.

                The funeral photographs evidence the micro economy environment of the block, which relies heavily on transportation of the La Salle Station, including wagon shops, railroad ticket booths, and hotels to accommodate the travelers. One would understand that this area, the so-called Chinatown, or Chinese colony in the words of immigrant inspectors, was in fact a more diverse and integrated space with people flowing from different regions across the United States and Europe. It was filled with communications, probably, bargains, and interactions. The Chinese immigrant didn’t only live mysteriously inside the buildings on that block on South Clark Street. They moved around for their professions and worked the same way as other “Americans” do. The illustration of the neighborhood in the shape of one-story exotic pavilions and the title of “Chinatown” were stereotypical. The bulk of residents living in the little apartments or hotels on South Clark Street should not be regarded as danger, vice, or harm; they instead brought many economic opportunities and generated great profits in the area and the nation of the United States. Thus, this research project, using the title of “Mapping Chicago’s Lost Chinatown” intends to engage conversations and subvert the definition of Chinese descent’s culture and the geographical and ideological zoning of Chinatown in the United States.

                Shu Chong Lung Co. is around the same or smaller size than that of Wing Chong Hai Co. mentioned above. It came in slightly later than the other companies, after the death of Sam Moy in May 1902. The founding story of the company gives great insights into the business strategy and fluid diasporic journey of Chinese merchants back in the day, coming from the West and East Coast to the Midwest. It also shows a collaborative family-initiated business and a good supportive and steady relationship between the manager and staff in their business. The manager is George Sing/Goon Sing/Gune Sing, who had come to the States before 1883 (File 648). In the interview provided on January 17, 1907, George Sing stated that the Co. had correspondingly $10000 stock of goods in hand and had 12 partners in total (File 466); later on February 28, 1908, the number dropped to $6000 stock of goods but still maintaining 9 full-time employees in the company (File 648).

                The staff list in 1908 includes George Sing, Moy Bow, Chin Loon, Goon Sue, Goon Bon Kee, Goon Fong Chink, Chin Dock Yin, and Chin Tong, despite Goon Yuen who was the applicant of that file would be going to China at the moment.

                The former body of Shu Chong Lung Co. was first the business of Quong Wing Co. opened in 1899 at 11 Mott Street and later closed around 1903. In late 1902, George Sing visited Chicago, for which reason we don’t know but possibly for business venturing, in late 1902, and during which he bought a restaurant at 98 E. Randolph St, I deduce, from the hand of Goon Gen Yim who owned the restaurant for 6-7 years prior and became the manager of Quong Lun Chung Co./Mee Lung Co. at 331 S. Clark St (File 680). Earlier that year, his 21-year-old nephew, Goon Yuen, who called George Sing uncle and was visited by the latter when he was a baby back in Seattle, wrote to George Sing possibly for financial support or employment since his parents both went back to China, leaving him alone. Thus, George Sing paid for Goon Yuen’s ticket from Seattle to New York and worked at Quong Wing Co. temporarily.

                To start the Chop Suey restaurant business at 98 E. Randolph St, known as Quen Ying Kue (Restaurant), George Sing decided to send the young, capable Goon Yuen to become the manager of the restaurant at the age of 21 in late 1902, when George Sing himself returned to New York to wrap up and sell the business of Quong Wing Co.. Though doubts were raised about Goon Yuen’s native-born citizenship by the inspectors, they believed he was doing great business and suggested him go through the other track of applying as a merchant. It would take great courage and ability to start an entire business almost on his own with no prior knowledge of the area or the restaurant. While George Sing was away in New York, the business at 98 E. Randolph seemed to be well operated and quite valuable that more than a year later, when George Sing decided to reopen a store, that sold tea, groceries, provision, Chinese and Japanese merchandise, George Sing would able to sell half interest of the restaurant, including the share of Goon Yuen, to put into the new store which was the Shu Chong Lung Co. at the basement of 293 S. Clark St in the year of 1904. With a stable business growing and side income continuing to flow from the restaurant (which was still managed by Yuen Yee King and George Sing in 1905), Shu Chong Lung Co. was able to move to the storefront of 341 S. Clark St in the year of 1906.

                Shu Chong Lung’s story might not be as grand as the priors but it demonstrates the different forms of the development of Chinese business in Chicago. The business not only followed one person’s diasporic journey, but it also anchored at one place with its special memory, legacy, and property, witnessing the come-and-go, rise-and-fall of the people who operated it. The trajectory of the Goon uncle and nephew from (Seattle to) New York to Chicago, from Quong Wing Co. to Quen Ying Kue restaurant, and to Shu Chong Lung Co. is the first case. Then, the second place would be 98 E. Randolph St and many laundry houses around the town. Oftentimes, a Chinese business would continue to be owned by people within the community or larger clan family, and maintain their original business since the facilities were often preserved. The diasporic journey and enduring spatial memory of a place are what weave such colorful and astounding stories and the history of Chinese American immigrants. Transcontinental business and relocation were very frequent and some immigrants in Chicago had once worked or resided and even been born in 740 Commercial Street, San Francisco. Hostels or business stations in Hong Kong on the Des Voeux Streets witnessed thousands of transactions and letters back and forth between the immigrants, their families in China, and businesses in the US.

                Hong Sling was among one of the most influential merchants in Chicago’s Chinese community. His store, Sam Lung Co., was one of the largest establishments on South Clark Street as well. The company constantly had a $15000-20000 stock of goods on hand around 1906 (file 535, 579). Hong Sling’s stories in Chicago could be traced way back to the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, in which he participated as one of the three main partners of the organization, Wah Mee Exposition Co., of the Chinese pavilion on Midway Plaisance, rivaling that of Sam Moy, successfully conducting a transnational business showcase (as it was indeed a notorious and colonial cultural and anthropological display), but unavoidably facing bankruptcy due to the great expenses incurred in the process. (see <a href="https://ccamuseum.org/rival-chinese-exposition-plans/">“Rival Chinese Exposition Plans”</a> on the Chinese American Museum of Chicago website, and Huping Ling (2005), 88-89.) A lot of Chinese immigrants saw the World’s Exposition more as an economic opportunity instead of an event demonstrating national pride (as a Qing Dynasty Chinese citizen) but unfortunately suffered great loss due to unproportional organization and investment.

                Sam Lung Co. was opened in 1898 first on Wabash Avenue but soon moved to the address of 299 S. Clark St before the renaming of street numbers in Chicago in the early 1910s. Operated by the Hong Family, possibly the last name “Tang 汤” in Mandarin Chinese. The company also has a branch in Ogden, Utah, due to Hong Sling’s early days in Ogden as a labor contractor or railroad agent. (Ling 2005, 87; file 535). The company also operated another branch of the restaurant business, which is Hong Fong Lo at 296 State St, later 278-80 State St, with more than $45000 capital in 1906 (file 394). The majority of the staff of Sam Lung Co. would have shares in Hong Fong Lo as well. Hong Sling’s smaller investment also includes Asia Tea Co. at 289 43rd St.

              <p>
                In the year 1906, the full-time staff in the store are Jin/Gin Ham (file 364), Soo Hoo See (Hong Sling’s wife, file 476; 430), Hong Fat, Hong Yick (file 481), Hong Jark, Hong Gee (file 579), Jin Yit Quong, Hong Woo (potentially file 535), and Hong Sling (file 364; 370; 375; 394; 415; 420; 462; 481; 607; 641) himself. In this business, Soo Hoo See/She, one of the rarely seen and often hidden female figures in the Chinese community, acts as a merchant with her individual investment portfolios, assistant bookkeeper, and cashier at the Company, aiding her husband’s business (file 376). Sam Lung Co.’s business seemed to concentrate on the big family of Hong Sling (not quite the large clan family sharing the same last name), with his wife, brother-in-law, as well as his adopted son Hong Yick.

                The diasporic journey was never exclusive to one generation. It elapses through the days following the first generation. Transnational separation between parents and children was common while familial bonds exceeding immediate family were often fostered. Hong Yick, the son of Hong Sling’s brother, was adopted by Hong Sling and taken back to the States from China when the former was twelve years old in the year of 1898, which was 8 years before the interview/application (file 481); Hong Yick’s sister Hong Hee was adopted as well. Hong Sling was able to send Hong Yick to the Jones school in Chicago for 3-4 years and let the child join the Co. to learn business, gain a living on his own while purchasing a part of the share of the company for Hong Yick under the latter’s name, thus obtaining a greater freedom to go through different kinds of inspections and affairs, including this return application. Such a relationship was similar to that between George Sing and Goon Yuen of Shu Chong Lung Co. mentioned above.

                Family legacies often continue in Chinatown. Another example, outside Hong Sling’s company, would be Lee Tung/Lee Yick Tung (File 631), a merchant at Yuen Chung Tung Co. 337 S. Clark St, was well respected as the son of a famous and established Chinese physician Lee Yik Non, meanwhile continuing his father’s business.
