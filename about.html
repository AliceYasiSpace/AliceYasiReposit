               <p>     Mapping Chicago’s Lost Chinatown project acknowledges that the land Chinese immigrants have been residing in Chicago, was of the homelands of the Anishinaabe, 
                or the Council of the Three Fires: the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations, as well as the Nations of Myaamia, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac and Fox, Peonia, 
                Kaskaskia, Wea, Kickapoo, and Mascouten who considered the area as their home. Chicago has long been a center for Indigenous people to gather, trade, and live. 
                In the past and present, the Chinese immigrants in Chicago and the purported “Chinatown” area reject the notion of establishing colonization or colony on the land 
                of the Native people.

                <p>     Mapping Chicago’s Lost Chinatown is a trans-disciplinary project led by Alexander Weinberg, Ph.D. candidate at the Economics Department of University of Chicago,
                    and Alice Yasi Xie, Master's student at the Modern and Contemporary Art History Program of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, 
                    for the Graduate Collaboration Grants of the <a href = "https://www.artsscienceculture.uchicago.edu/graduate-collaboration-grants"> Arts, Science + Culture Initiative</a>. 
                This project will combine art historical and ethnographic research with tools from economic history, machine learning, spatial data science, and urban economics. 
                Our final product will be a website with an interactive map where users can learn about the stories and history of residents and businesses in Chicago’s lost Chinatown.
                </p> 

                <p>     The project will fill a significant gap in previous scholars’ studies on Chicago Chinatown–the inability to visualize–and therefore conceptualize 
                and directly understand Chicago's initial and historical Chinatown through digital visualization. It will be the first map of Chicago’s Lost Chinatown. 
                In this visualization of the community, we hope to shed light on the built experienced geography of lost Chinatown and immigrant economic and social adaptation to Chicago. 
                </p>

                <p>     Historical context: In the 1880s, some Chinese immigrants left California under the pressure of intensified racism and labor conflicts. 
                The early Chinese community in Chicago built a prosperous neighborhood in what is now the South Loop near to the LaSalle Train Station, 
                centered around the intersection of Van Buren, South Clark and Harrison Streets. The South Loop became the heart of the Chinese American community in the Midwest. 
                In 1912, pushed by anti-Chinese discrimination and changing economic conditions, the Chinese community began moving south to “New Chinatown” centered at the corner of Wentworth and Cermak.
                </p>

                <p>     Research Timeline: Our first step is to use a customized convolutional neural network with built-in Optical Character Recognition 
                    to digitize historical business directories from 1890-1920 (Shen et. al 2021). 
                We will merge the directory data on business addresses with data on household residential addresses from Census records (Ruggles et. al. 2023). 
                Meanwhile, the immigrants' individual files stored at the National Archives will be joined to form the bulk of the mapping data and narratives.
                A model with the summarized information of the business will be built on the sanborn maps of the area.
                This will allow us to map how the original Chinatown changed over time and how Chinese immigrants chose where to live and start businesses. 
                </p>
                
                <p>     Next we will augment our digital map of Chinatown to allow users to explore lost Chinatown visually and interactively and learn about the people and business that gave it life. 
                Users of the map will be able to click on a residential building or business location and explore records from the archival photographs, immigration documents, printed business slips, 
                and other cultural materials from the residents, workers, and business owners located there.
                </p>

                <p>    The website will provide maps of Chicago Chinatown in the year of 1906 in order to shed light on how the social and economic fabric of old Chinatown developed. 
                    The true objective of this project is to help the public understand the culture and social relationship Chinese community. By actualizing the geography landscape of the 
                    first Chinese neighborhood in Chicago, such a research supports an alternative meaning of the term "Chinatown," which has been demarcating and separating
                    the Chinese community in a geographical region with the rejection of cultural communication and assimilation in the United States, and provides learning opportunities for public to understand
                    the reasons behind the deconstruction and neglect of this neighborhood.

                        Alex and I are deeply grateful for the assistance of program director Naomi Blumberg and Dr. Nicole Hall 
                        as well as the advice provided by our faculty mentors Dr. Emily Talen and Dr. Jennifer Dorothy Lee. 
                        Dr. Yue Lin in the Division of the Social Sciences at University of Chicago further supported our consultation on the application of QGIS system and mapping method.
                        The website was developed under the help of Francisco Barba Cuellar.
                        Eventually, this project is deeply indebted to the tremendous support and care from the team of National Archives at Chicago over the course of my five months of visit 
                        and digitization of the immigrant files.
