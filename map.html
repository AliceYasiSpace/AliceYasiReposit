            The following interactive map is built on the QGIS system and uploaded through Felt.
            It juxtaposes images of the neighborhood in early 1900s, the Sanborn map of the neighborhood in 1906 over the 2024 Google Earth Map, 
            showing the change of the area over the course of the past 100 years through relocation, demolition, and renovation.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this map, the viewers can click through individual boxes to see information of the individual business which
            will be further unfolded under the "Stories-individual/business" section of the MCLC website. Further, the transparency of 
            individual layer of the map is controllable and playable. Overall, the map should provide a good knowledge of what
            the Chinese business and community would look like back in the first ten years of the twentieth-century Chicago.
